# Intrusion Detection Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which is designed for evaluating intrusion detection systems. The primary objective is to perform a comprehensive data analysis to extract meaningful insights and visualizations regarding different types of attacks. The analysis includes data overview, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance assessment, and visualizations.

## Objectives

- **Data Overview**: Understand the structure and statistics of the dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution of the target variable and relationships between features.
- **Visualizations**: Create engaging visualizations to summarize findings.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify the key features that contribute to the classification of different attack types.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is the **UNSW-NB15** dataset, which contains network traffic data labeled with various attack types. The training and testing sets are loaded from CSV files.
